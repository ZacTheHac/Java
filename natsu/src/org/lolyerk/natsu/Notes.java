	てｘなつ is literally "Te x natsu"
	or: テキサスの夏 is "Tekisasu no natsu" which is "texas summer", could go with テキサスのなつ to stay w/ morenatsu's spelling of summer
	to shorten: テスのなつ for "summer of tess" (to fit with texnatsu) "Tesu no Natsu"
		or even: テスなつ for "tess summer"="Tesu Natsu"
	or I could get it to work perfectly with テックス夏 "Tekkusu natsu" and translates to "Tex summer"
		maybe insert の so it's テックスの夏 = "Tekkusu no natsu" for "Summer of Tex"

	Tex-natsu write up
General Plot:  You get a graduation party invitation from your old childhood friends.  Seems they’re all graduating highschool and holding a party.  You had to move away before middle school, but you’ve always meant to come back and visit.  This seems like the last chance to have everyone be together for one last summer, so off you go to make memories before it’s too late.  It follows roughly the same trope events as Morenatsu; a beach episode, camping episode, 4th of July festival, etc.
Characters are still in development, so these 

aren’t final.

Tyson “Ty” Conrad
Age: 18
Species: Bull
Tyson, or Ty for short, is an out-going goof-ball.  He plays for his highschool football team.  He’s the guy who’s kept the group of friends together since childhood.  He’s the one who writes to you to come back and visit for the summer.

Blake Jackson
Age: 19
Species: Horse
Blake is easy-going almost to the point to laziness.  He doesn’t like all the hard work that comes with living on a farm.

Armando “Mondo” Reyes
Age: 18
Species: Coyote
Mondo is an all around nice guy, but not very smart.  He was a track star, but also played football with Ty.

Josh Oliver
Age: 18
Species: Hawk
Josh is outspoken and smart.  He’s a theater buff, and dreams of one day performing on Broadway.

Adam Caro
Age: 18
Species: Bobcat
Adam is a good-hearted outdoorsman.  He’s been in the scouts since he was a kid, and is trying to acheve his final rank in the scouts.

Jorge San Nicolas
Age: 18
Species: Boar
Jorge is completely into nerd culture such as comics, anime, and video games and wants to become a comic book artist.

Kenta Yamashita
Age: 18
Species: Bat
Ken is a reclusive goth type.  If it wasn’t for his friends, he might never leave his room.  He likes reading novels and would like to write his own someday.

Diego Abel
Age: 18
Species: Crocodile
Diego is an overactive gamer and computer geek.  He’s the town computer wiz and spends a lot of time repairing them.  He wishes the town had a faster internet connection.

Casey Ramser
Age: 19
Species: Deer
Casey is a stuck-up hipster.  He plays trombone in a ska band and doesn’t like the “country scene” that surrounds him.
